# GitFlow Class

This repository was used for me to learn about GitFlow, how it works and how to use it in a project.

## How to use GitFlow in a project 

. Create a repository;
. From the terminal, go to the folder where you want to insert the project;
. If I start the project with a README.md, make a git clone:
git clone link_repository
. Go to the project folder:
cd project_name
. Start gitflow: 
git flow init
. Type the name of the production branch (main) (or just press enter)
. Type the name of the development branch (develop) (or just press enter)
. Type the name of the feature (feature) branch (or just enter)
. Type the name of the bugfix branch (bugfix) (or just press enter)
. Type the name of the release branch (or just press press enter)
. Type the name of the hotfix branch (or just press enter)
. Type the name of the support (support) branch (or just press enter)
. Type if you want a prefix tag in the version (the v that appears before 1.0, for example) (if you don't, just press enter)
. If you want to list the branches, do:
git branch â€”list
. If I want to changing a file, just do:
code README.md
